# TIC-TAC-TOE


The project aims at programming the game "Tic Tac Toe".

This game is a two-player game. It consists in filling in a board, composed of 9 squares, with cross and circles depending on the camp, in order to aligned 3 identical signs.

The first player who achieve this goal wins the game. If all squares have been filled in by a sign but there are no 3 aligned squares, the game is lost for both players.
 
 
 
## The simple version


In this version, the basic elements of the game are programming and allow players to play in a PvP mode (Player versus Player).

The code of the basic version is included on the file "tic_tac_toe.py".

## The improved version

The improved version includes a PvM mode (Player versus Monster). A Neural Network is implemented and learnt from the game it played.

The code of the basic version is included on the file "tic_tac_toe_plus.py".
